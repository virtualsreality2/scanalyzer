- Schema Tests: [PASS] - Pydantic v2 schemas working correctly
- Performance Tests: [PASS] - Database supports bulk operations efficiently
- Session Management: [PASS] - Async sessions working with proper rollback

## Performance Metrics
- Database initialization: < 3 seconds
- Table creation: All 3 tables created successfully
- Indexed fields: 15+ indexes created for optimal query performance

## Schema Validation
- File path traversal protection: [VERIFIED] - Validates against directory traversal
- JSON metadata flexibility: [VERIFIED] - Tool-specific metadata stored as JSON
- Enum validation: [VERIFIED] - Severity and status enums working correctly
