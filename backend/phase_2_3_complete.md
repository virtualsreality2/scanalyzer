# Phase 2.3 Completion Report

## Summary
Phase 2.3 - File Storage Service has been successfully implemented and validated.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Storage Service (`app/services/storage_service.py`)
- **Features Implemented:**
  - Secure file upload with comprehensive validation
  - File type validation (blocks executables, only allows report formats)
  - Size limit enforcement (100MB max)
  - Virus scanning integration (clamd when available)
  - Atomic writes using temporary files
  - Unique naming scheme: `{timestamp}_{hash}_{filename}`
  - Efficient file streaming for large files
  - Storage statistics reporting

### 2. Cleanup Service (`app/services/cleanup_service.py`)
- **Features Implemented:**
  - APScheduler integration for automated cleanup
  - Daily cleanup scheduled at 3 AM (configurable)
  - 3-month retention policy enforcement
  - Orphaned database record cleanup
  - Concurrent run prevention with asyncio locks
  - Storage usage monitoring and alerts
  - Manual force cleanup option

### 3. File Utilities (`app/utils/file_utils.py`)
- **Features Implemented:**
  - Safe path joining with traversal prevention
  - MIME type detection and validation
  - File hash calculation (SHA256)
  - Chunked file reading for efficiency
  - File info extraction
  - Human-readable file size formatting

## Security Features
1. **Path Traversal Prevention**: Validates all paths stay within base directory
2. **File Type Validation**: Blocks dangerous file types (EXE, scripts)
3. **MIME Type Verification**: Ensures file content matches extension
4. **Virus Scanning Ready**: Framework for clamd integration
5. **Atomic Operations**: No partial files on failure

## Performance Optimizations
1. **Chunked Reading**: 1MB chunks for efficient memory usage
2. **Async Operations**: All I/O operations are asynchronous
3. **Unique Naming**: Prevents filesystem collisions
4. **Storage Monitoring**: Tracks disk usage and alerts on high usage

## Configuration
- Storage directory: Platform-specific (`~/.local/share/Scanalyzer/uploads` on Linux)
- Max file size: 100MB (configurable)
- Retention period: 90 days (configurable)
- Cleanup schedule: Daily at 3:00 AM (configurable)

## Dependencies Added
- `python-magic`: Enhanced MIME type detection
- `apscheduler`: Scheduled cleanup tasks
- `aiofiles`: Asynchronous file operations

## Testing Results
All components tested and validated:
- ✅ File upload and validation
- ✅ Size and type restrictions
- ✅ Unique naming and deduplication
- ✅ File streaming
- ✅ Cleanup scheduling
- ✅ Path security
- ✅ Error handling

## Cleanup Summary
- Test directories removed: ✓
- Test files cleaned from storage: ✓
- Python cache cleared: ✓
- No test artifacts remaining: ✓

## Ready for Next Phase
The file storage service is fully operational and ready for:
- Phase 2.4: API endpoints implementation
- Integration with file parsers
- WebSocket updates for upload progress

Phase 2.3 completed and validated: Wed Jun 11 5:42 PM MST 2025
