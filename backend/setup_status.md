# Backend Setup Status Report

## Current State

### Environment Setup
- Python Version: 3.12.3
- Virtual Environment: Created at `backend/venv/`
- Working Directory: `/mnt/c/Users/jaype/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/scanalyzer/backend`

### Configuration
- `.env` file: Created from `.env.example` template
- All environment variables are set with default values
- Secret key needs to be updated for production

### Dependencies Installation
- Poetry is not installed on the system
- Attempted to install dependencies via pip in virtual environment
- Installation is incomplete due to timeouts
- Partial installation includes:
  - uvicorn (confirmed installed)
  - Some core dependencies

### Application Structure
âœ… **Completed Components:**
- `app/main.py` - FastAPI application with middleware and exception handlers
- `app/core/config.py` - Pydantic settings with platform-specific paths
- `app/core/logging.py` - Structured logging with rotation and masking
- `app/core/exceptions.py` - Custom exception classes
- `app/db/base.py` - Async SQLAlchemy configuration
- `app/api/` - Router structure with placeholder endpoints

### Current Issues
1. **Dependency Installation**: The virtual environment package installation is timing out, likely due to network speed or package size
2. **FastAPI Module**: Not fully available yet in the virtual environment
3. **Database**: SQLite database not yet initialized

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. Complete dependency installation:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Install Poetry and use it
   pip install poetry
   cd backend
   poetry install
   
   # Option 2: Create requirements.txt from pyproject.toml
   # Then install with pip in smaller batches
   ```

2. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   alembic init alembic
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. Update the SECRET_KEY in .env file with a secure value

### To Run the Server (once dependencies are installed):
```bash
# From backend directory
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

## Project Structure Verification
All required backend directories and files have been created according to the specification:
- Core modules (config, logging, exceptions)
- Database setup with async support
- API router structure
- Test directories
- Storage directories for uploads/reports/cache

The backend architecture is ready for development once the dependency installation is resolved.
