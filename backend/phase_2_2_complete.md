# Phase 2.2 Completion Report

## Completed Tasks

### 1. SQLAlchemy Models Created
- **Report Model** (`app/models/report.py`)
  - Complete file metadata tracking
  - Status enum (pending, processing, completed, failed)
  - Automatic timestamps with timezone
  - Cascade delete for related findings
  - Finding count statistics

- **Finding Model** (`app/models/finding.py`)
  - Normalized core fields
  - Severity enum (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  - Flexible JSON metadata for tool-specific data
  - Support for references, tags, and categories
  - False positive and suppression tracking

- **ProcessingQueue Model** (`app/models/processing_queue.py`)
  - Priority-based queue system
  - Retry mechanism with configurable limits
  - Worker locking for distributed processing
  - Scheduled processing support

### 2. Pydantic Schemas Created
- **Common Schemas** (`app/schemas/common.py`)
  - Generic paginated response
  - Error and success responses
  - Health check response format

- **Report Schemas** (`app/schemas/report.py`)
  - Request/response models
  - File path traversal protection
  - Tool name validation
  - Pagination support

- **Finding Schemas** (`app/schemas/finding.py`)
  - Bulk creation support (up to 100,000 findings)
  - URL reference validation
  - Tag normalization
  - Flexible search parameters

### 3. Database Session Management
- **Session Module** (`app/db/session.py`)
  - Async context managers
  - Automatic rollback on errors
  - Connection health checks
  - Transaction management with savepoints

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Indexes Created**:
  - Reports: 3 composite indexes for common queries
  - Findings: 4 indexes including severity and tool queries  
  - Queue: 4 indexes for efficient queue operations

- **Design Decisions**:
  - JSON columns for flexible metadata
  - Bulk insert support
  - Efficient pagination
  - Connection pooling configured for desktop app

## Verification Results
- All models successfully create database tables
- Pydantic v2 schemas working with proper validation
- Database supports SQLite with async operations
- Indexes properly defined for query optimization

## Next Steps
Phase 2.2 is complete and ready for:
- Phase 2.3: API endpoints implementation
- Integration with file parsers
- WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
